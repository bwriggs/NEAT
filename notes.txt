idea for art / test
game of life (with genetic history)
give each individual a colour
each individual has some square view of the game,
including the genetic makeup of cells,
they can change the board within their view, move, or pass
fitness is evaluated by having the phenotypes compete to spread
their genes

additional mutation / system: add input
input to "function" is now a map of values
the network can evolve a view all possibly relevant inputs 

ideas for adding more evolution to NEAT

Epigenetics, protecting valuable DNA. Add another double field
to connections representing how likely they are to change.
can use std::discrete_distribution here

Competition: (just push this off to user code for now)
allow interaction of phenotypes during fitness evaluation
later, Environment, mapping from network output to Environment change,
mapping from Environment change to network input

Choice of mate:
separate network? with fixed inputs?
based on human (/animal) psychology, optimal degree of similarity
inputs are delta, fitness
maybe reduce to a few possible mates, then have genomes mate selection network choose
maybe barely reduce, really give higher fitness genomes first pick
